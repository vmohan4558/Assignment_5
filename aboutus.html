            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>At Light Their Way Home, our mission is to reunite missing children with their families by leveraging technology, community efforts, and public awareness. We are dedicated to using cutting-edge identification tools, databases, and search systems to aid in the safe recovery of missing children.</p>

                <p>With a team of skilled professionals and compassionate volunteers, we work closely with law enforcement agencies, NGOs, and concerned citizens to collect and distribute critical information about missing children. Through our platform, we provide a space where families can share details about their missing loved ones, and the public can offer tips and insights that might help in locating them.</p>
                
                <p>Our website serves as a comprehensive resource for child safety, abduction prevention, and ongoing missing child cases. We believe that no family should ever feel alone in the search for their missing child, and we are committed to providing support, hope, and actionable solutions in the fight against child abductions.</p>
